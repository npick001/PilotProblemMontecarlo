Problem Description:

Aerial bombing of ammunition dump

We are trying to find the probability that a pilot will hit within a radius of the ammunition dump. The program must allow for any number of trials. This code must work with any standard deviation in the x and y axes.

Bombing impacts are assumed to be normally distributed when there are more 30 trials.
//I will be trying 10,000 trials

Program will provide data for the sample mean, variance, and a 95% confidence interval for the mean.
//I will be doing 15 replications
